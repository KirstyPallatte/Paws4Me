He's a gorgeous boy, with soft, \"blue\" (dark gray) fur tinged in silver. He loves to flop on your lap, your bed, or on&nbsp;a kitty tower. <BR><BR>Tinsel is one of those pretty boys you knew in high school, and you think, \"Wow, I bet he's stuck up,\" but then you get to know him, and he's a genuinely nice guy--you just can't say a bad thing about Tinsel. He lives in a house full of adult foster cats, and every one of them accepts him. He's just that kind of guy. Okay, sometimes there is a smack on the head or a snarl when that kittenish energy just overflows onto the ancient adult fur!<BR><BR>Where'd he get his name? Well, he and his brother and sisters were abandoned in a carrier by a dumpster with another litter of kittens--Candy Cane and Gingerbread Manny. These poor babies were just weaned and skinny and full of ringworm. How could we turn away? If they were to go to a shelter, they would have been killed.<BR><BR>When we looked at the calendar to see when they'd be ready for adoption, it was going to be right around Christmas! How could we resist?<BR><BR>Would you like to meet this love bug? Would you like to get to know this ambassador of kitten good will? <BR><BR>Go to his webpage on <A href=\"http://www.happycatadoptions.org/\" mce_href=\"http://www.HappyCatAdoptions.org\">www.HappyCatAdoptions.org</A> and under his photo, click the adoptions link to get to the online application form. Yes, it's long. But it really helps us to make sure we're making a good match. <BR><BR>. <BR><BR>For more information, contact Tinsel's foster dad directly at haroldw1@sbcglobal.net.<BR></SPAN></P><img src=\"https://tracker.rescuegroups.org/pet?1038035\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" alt=\"\" />",
